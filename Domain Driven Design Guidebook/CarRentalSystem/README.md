## Project Overview:

This project is based on the guidebook titled "**Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture Guidebook**" by **[Ivaylo Kenov](https://github.com/ivaylokenov)**. 
The guidebook provides a structured approach to learning and implementing Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture in .NET applications. 
This repository serves as a practical companion, allowing you to apply these concepts directly to code.

 ## Objectives:
  - **Learn and Implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Understand how to structure complex business logic into manageable domains, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
  - **Apply Clean Architecture Principles:** Develop applications that are flexible, scalable, and easy to test, with a clear separation of concerns.
  - **Hands-On Practice:** Work on real-world projects and exercises that reinforce the theoretical concepts covered in the guidebook.
